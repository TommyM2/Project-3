This is a Flask-based weather application built to provide real-time weather information for a given city. The app pulls data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays key weather details including the city name, current temperature, and weather conditions.

How It Works:

2. The application fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
3. The data is parsed and presented to the user with the current weather details for that city.

Features:
- Displays current weather details such as city name, temperature, and weather conditions.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface for retrieving weather information.

Requirements:
- Flask
- Requests

Instructions:
1. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
2. Obtain an OpenWeatherMap API key and set it in the app.
3. Run the Flask app using the command `python mod13_[pawprint].py`.
4. Access the app locally via a web browser and input a city name to view its weather.
